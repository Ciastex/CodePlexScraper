## Why
They're shutting down CodePlex Archive in July 2021 and something tells me not everyone migrated...

## How
1. [Download .NET 5 SDK.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
2. Install it.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Navigate to the directory you cloned this repository into and run `dotnet build -c Release`. Your binaries should be located in `CodePlexScraper/bin/Release/net5.0/`.
